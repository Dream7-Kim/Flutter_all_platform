# Flutter

A demo app showcasing how Flutter can deliver a great multi-platform experience, targeting iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, and web. Built by [gskinner](https://gskinner.com) in partnership with Google, Flutter Folio purposefully considers user expectations, input devices and idioms for each platform, ensuring it feels at home on every device.

### Installation

If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). 

Once Flutter is setup, you can use the latest `stable` channel:
 * Run `flutter channel stable`
 * Run `flutter upgrade`

Once you're on `dev` and desktop is enabled, you're ready to run the app:
* `flutter run -d windows`
* `flutter run -d macos`
* `flutter run -d linux`
* `flutter run -d android`
* `flutter run -d ios`
* `flutter run -d web`

If you re-start your IDE, you should also see a new launch option for your current desktop platform.
